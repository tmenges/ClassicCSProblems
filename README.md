Implementations of classic computer science problems

The problems are taken from [_Classic Computer Science Problems in Python_](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python) by David Kopec.

I thnk that initially I will try implementing the problems in Python (given in the book), C++, Java and Common Lisp. Eventually it would be fun to try Haskell, OCaml and some others such as Erlang or Elixir.
